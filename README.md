# Data Analysis Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from raw data ingestion to insights delivery. It showcases core data analyst skills including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, and business-focused visualization and reporting.

The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights from data and communicate them clearly through dashboards and presentations.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported raw data into Python using Pandas
   - Performed initial structure and data quality checks

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships
   - Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing and invalid values
   - Standardized column names and data types
   - Created derived fields where necessary

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL and SQLite
   - Wrote SQL queries to:
     - Aggregate metrics
     - Validate Python-based findings
     - Answer business-driven questions

5. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize:
     - Key metrics and KPIs
     - Trends over time
     - Segment-level breakdowns

6. **Reporting & Presentation**
   - Created a written report summarizing insights and methodology
   - Designed a presentation using Gamma to communicate results clearly to non-technical stakeholders

---

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- High-level KPI overview
- Interactive filters for deeper analysis
- Clear, business-oriented visualizations

---

## Results & Insights
Key outcomes from the analysis include:
- Identification of major trends and patterns in the data
- Data-driven insights supporting decision-making
- Clear visual storytelling suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences
